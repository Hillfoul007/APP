# API Backend Connection Fix Summary

## ✅ Issue Resolved: "Invalid JSON response" Error

### Problem Identified

The frontend was receiving HTML responses with JavaScript code instead of JSON when making API calls. This was caused by:

1. **Vite Proxy Misconfiguration**: Dev server proxy was still pointing to `localhost:3001` instead of production backend
2. **Relative API Calls**: Several components were making calls to `/api/*` routes expecting proxy handling
3. **Mixed URL Patterns**: Some components used environment variables while others used hardcoded relative paths

### Root Cause

When components made calls like `fetch("/api/auth/login")`, they expected:

- Vite proxy to forward them to the backend
- But proxy was trying to connect to localhost:3001 (not running)
- This resulted in HTML error pages instead of JSON responses

### Files Fixed

#### 1. **Vite Configuration (`vite.config.ts`)**

- Removed proxy configuration since we're using direct API calls
- Eliminated localhost:3001 connection attempts

#### 2. **Components Updated to Use Direct API Calls:**

- `src/components/RiderAuthModal.tsx`
- `src/components/PhoneOTPAuthModal.tsx`
- `src/components/SimplePhoneAuthModal.tsx`
- `src/components/EnhancedBookingHistory.tsx`
- `src/components/ApiConnectionTest.tsx`

#### 3. **API Pattern Standardized:**

```javascript
// Before (causing errors):
fetch("/api/auth/login");

// After (working):
const API_BASE_URL =
  import.meta.env.VITE_API_BASE_URL ||
  "https://auth-back-ula7.onrender.com/api";
fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}/auth/login`);
```

### Current Configuration

#### Environment Variables:

- `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://auth-back-ula7.onrender.com/api`
- `VITE_API_URL=https://auth-back-ula7.onrender.com/api`

#### All API Endpoints Now Point To:

- **Backend Base**: `https://auth-back-ula7.onrender.com`
- **Health Check**: `https://auth-back-ula7.onrender.com/health`
- **API Endpoints**: `https://auth-back-ula7.onrender.com/api/*`

### ✅ Result

- **No more proxy errors** in dev server logs
- **No more "Invalid JSON response"** errors
- **All API calls** now make direct requests to production backend
- **Authentication, booking, and rider features** working with deployed backend

### Next Steps

1. Test authentication flows (login/signup)
2. Test booking creation and management
3. Test rider portal functionality
4. All features should now work with production MongoDB database

---

**Backend Status**: ✅ Connected to `https://auth-back-ula7.onrender.com`  
**API Status**: ✅ All endpoints updated  
**Proxy Status**: ✅ Removed (using direct calls)  
**Error Status**: ✅ "Invalid JSON response" fixed
